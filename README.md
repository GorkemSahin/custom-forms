# Custom Forms

This is a simple React app that generates forms based on the provided JSON configuration. Please refer to the `FormConfig` TS interface in the `src/utils/types.ts` file or the `FORM_CONFIG_EXAMPLE` object in the `src/utils/const.tsx` file to see what kind of JSON object input is expected. The `FORM_CONFIG_EXAMPLE` object is used as the initial value of the Form Config Input component so that the app can be demonstrated quickly without having to write down a valid JSON object.
